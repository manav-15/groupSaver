- Styling done
- Open Group in a new window (Although the tabs are not in a grp)
- Delete group entry from local storage

Next - 

Add listeners whenever-
 -- A tab is added/removed from a grp
 -- New Grp is made

Easier soln for above -
    - A refresh button which updates grps, add new grps and keeps the former grps which are closed
    - Implemented 

Next -

Change to scrollable list
Look for corner cases/bugs
Think- opening a new grp results in the opened tabs being grouped
